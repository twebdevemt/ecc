Execute the full git autopush workflow:

## Steps

1. **Check prerequisites**
    - Verify this is a git repository: `git rev-parse --git-dir`
    - Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
    - If either fails, explain the issue and how to fix it

2. **Stage all changes**

    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```

    - If no changes to stage, inform the user and stop

3. **Generate a descriptive commit message**
    - Analyze the staged changes:
        ```bash
        git diff --cached --stat
        git diff --cached
        ```
    - Create a commit message following this format:

        ```
        <type>(<scope>): <concise summary>

        <detailed description explaining what changed and why>

        - Specific change 1
        - Specific change 2
        - etc.
        ```

    - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`
    - Be specific about files and functionality changed

4. **Commit the changes**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "<generated message>"
    ```

5. **Push to remote**

    ```bash
    BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
    git push origin "$BRANCH"
    ```

    - If push fails due to upstream changes, pull with rebase and retry:
        ```bash
        git pull --rebase origin "$BRANCH"
        git push origin "$BRANCH"
        ```

6. **Create a pull request**

    ```bash
    gh pr create --title "<title from commit>" --body "<detailed PR description>" --base main
    ```

    - If a PR already exists for this branch, skip this step and note it

7. **Merge the pull request**
    ```bash
    gh pr merge
    ```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

If the PR cannot be merged due to conflicts:

1. **Identify the conflicts**:

    ```bash
    gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
    git fetch origin main
    git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
    ```

2. **Report to the user**:
    - List each conflicting file
    - Explain that conflicts occur when the same lines were modified in both branches

3. **Provide resolution instructions**:

    ```
    To resolve these conflicts:

    1. Fetch and merge main:
       git fetch origin main
       git merge origin/main

    2. Open each conflicting file and find the conflict markers:
       <<<<<<< HEAD
       (your changes)
       =======
       (changes from main)
       >>>>>>> origin/main

    3. Edit the file to keep the correct code (remove the markers)

    4. Stage the resolved files:
       git add <file1> <file2> ...

    5. Complete the merge:
       git commit

    6. Push and the PR will update:
       git push
    ```

4. **Offer to help** resolve specific conflicts if the user wants

## Error Handling

- **Not a git repo**: Tell user to run `git init` or navigate to a repository
- **No GitHub remote**: Tell user to add one with `git remote add origin <url>`
- **Auth failure**: Tell user to run `gh auth login`
- **Protected branch**: Tell user to create a feature branch first with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- **No changes**: Inform user there's nothing to commit
